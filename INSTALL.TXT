Installation instructions for Debian based systems
==================================================

1. Install the following packages: `python python-django python-django-registration python-django-tagging python-docutils python-dateutil python-geoip postgresql python-vobject binutils postgresql-8.3 python-psycopg2 python-setuptools python-vobject`

1. Edit `settings_local.py`

1. As root edit your `/etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf` file to include: `local all gridcalendar md5`

1. Reload the configuration: `killall -HUP postgres`

1. Create the GridCalendar `postgres` user with a password ::
    $ su
    # su postgres
    postgres$ createuser --pwprompt gridcalendar
    Enter password for new role:
    Enter it again:
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
    Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n

1. Create the gridcalendar database: ::
    postgres$ createdb -U gridcalendar -O gridcalendar gridcalendar
    Password:

1. Install the Django tables: ::
    $ cd /usr/local/gridcalendar/
    $ python manage.py syncdb
    ...
    You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
    Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes
    ...

1. If using Apache edit apache/django.wsgi and replace the path of the installation.

1. If Apache is used, for development it is recommended to include the following line in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` ::
        MaxRequestsPerChild 1
   It makes the server reload every request, in order to be able to see changes immediately. Remove this in the production version.
