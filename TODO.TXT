- bug: in text mode introduce one or more urls which are not called web
- bug: event 557 search_engines
- bug: search 2011-04-01 2011-04-31

high priority
-------------

- accept search 2011-04
- contact form, terminate with: 'Thanks for contacting us. We'll try our best to reply in a timely
  fashion.'
- Don't use two columns (related events) in the result of a search with location
- run the tests of django_tables
- accept urls with no http:// and spaces 
- SEO optimization: tags, titles, for each view, event, etc.
- Add stats for screen size and media capabilities of visitors: http://awstats.sourceforge.net/docs/awstats_faq.html#SCREENSIZE
- Use a descriptive title and h1 for the page showing a search result. Examples:

    - Events in Berlin
    - Events in Berlin belonging to the group(s) ...
    - Events IN Berlin TAGGED AS aaa bbb 

- Think about which characters are allowed for event titles, group names, etc.
  and modify the code accordingly (not only for inputs, but also for searches,
  etc.)
- create a field for each event which stores the unix time (seconds from 1.1.1970) for the next
  coming date. With this efficient sorting and slicing is possible
- use python-django-lint
- use user profiles and store their location and language preference. See
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/auth/#storing-additional-information-about-users
- prevent spamming the refresh button <-> catching ; see
    http://efreedom.com/Question/1-1212559/Spam-Proof-Hit-Counter-Django
- repeating events. When deleting, e.g. Google shows a window like this::

    Delete recurring event
    Would you like to delete only this event, all events in the series, or this and all future events in the series?
    Only this instance | All events in the series | All following | Don't delete

- mercurial hook for accepting changes which validate with ``./manage.py validate``
- notifications with e.g. -10days for interesting events.
- accept names in other languages, see http://www.geonames.org/
- Add the attribute `alters_data` to all methods which alters data, see
  http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter04/
- translations

    - Check that all strings to be translated uses the Python's standard named-string interpolation
      syntax, and not positional interpolation (e.g., %s or %d). See
      http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/i18n/internationalization/
    - http://code.google.com/p/django-rosetta/
    - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/i18n/localization/

- Implement optimistic looking and transactions when e.g. saving/changing an event as a text. See
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/320096/django-how-can-i-protect-against-concurrent-modification-of-data-base-entries
- urls with hashes should be different for each group, filter, etc.
- When committing remove and create new data base creating automatically a new super user to avoid
  the question:
      You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
      Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): 
- Rename events.EventTimechunk
- See and edit http://code.gridcalendar.net/wiki/DataFormats
- profile:
    - change password
    - list of interests
    - groups with the option for notification for new event and for new member
- message after a submission: "Thanks for submitting: <name>"
- add new group
- group view
- add change password and delete account. Already implemented in the registration
- bug: after logout the form at home is not rendered
- add 'term of service' at registration and at adding a new event, etc.
- add 'help page'
- add 'add group' and 'add tag' to an event
- add to user profile an option for receiving notifications by email for group invitations.
- program logic for group invitation after clicking url in email, write the email templates, etc.
- Think of a most generic error page (404). See
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1812470/django-custom-handler404-shows-404-but-gives-header-200
- SEO: http://s1-suchmaschinenoptimierung.de/google-seo-starter-guide/
- install and use packages iso-codes. Description: ISO language, territory, currency, script codes
  and their translations This package provides the ISO 639 and ISO 639-3 language code lists, the
  ISO 4217 currency code list, the ISO 3166 territory code list, the ISO 3166-2 sub-territory list,
  and the ISO 15924 script code list as XML files. More importantly, it also provides their
  translations to be used by other programs. Homepage: http://pkg-isocodes.alioth.debian.org/
- tags lists are limited, indicate it so that users know there are more tags, e.g. of the code at
  the moment::

    event.get_tags|slice:":10"

- Geo for searching with distance ranges like within 50 km

    - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/contrib/gis/geoquerysets/
    - heck out http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/GeoDjango
    - Postgresql extension 

medium priority
---------------

- pictures for events and groups::

    "2011-02-27 14:01" < netAction> ogai: md5(Uhrzeit in Minuten + PK + geheimwort)
    "2011-02-27 14:01" < netAction> Der Bilderserver bekommt eine Anfrage nach einer URL mit diesem MD5.
    "2011-02-27 14:02" < ogai> netAction: sehr gut
    "2011-02-27 14:02" < netAction> Er probiert die letzten 30 Minuten durch. Das geheimwort hat er auch. Wenn er dann keine PK hat, ist die MD5 falsch oder abgelaufen.
    "2011-02-27 14:02" < netAction> Dafür gibts nen Apache-Modul, die URL lässt sich in einer Zeile Python erzeugen. 
    "2011-02-27 14:02" < ogai> netAction: moment wieso uhrzeit in minuten? uhrzeit der hochladung auf grical?
    "2011-02-27 14:03" < netAction> Nein Uhrzeit, zu der die URL erstellt wurde.
    "2011-02-27 14:03" < netAction> Damit die URL abläuft.
    "2011-02-27 14:04" < ogai> wer soll wissen, wenn eine url ablaeuft? apache?
    "2011-02-27 14:05" < netAction> Ja.
    "2011-02-27 14:05" < netAction> Ich suche dir das Modul raus.

- 3 layers for 'Custom Fields': grical installation on settings, sessions for an event (e.g. room
  number), groups (e.g. who is responsible)
- add an agreement field to accept publication under CC for non-logged-in users. For logged in, add
  an agreement field when creating a new account, see http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/785/
- better usability for normal people. Some comments from IRC:

    - "2011-02-21 15:51" < netAction> Dieses @ und # und die bescheuerte Angabe von Daten finde ich jetzt schon nervig.
    - "2011-02-21 18:38" < netAction> SvenG: Im ersten Anlauf durch einzelne Felder in der Suche.  Ich weiß, das ist veraltet. Dann eben durch eine wirklich mitdenkende Suche. Setz 10 Leute vor Grical und sag ihnen, sie sollen die Events suchen, die sie interessieren. Ich bin gespannt, was dann passiert.
    - "2011-02-21 18:59" < netAction> SvenG: Die Logik für die Suche ist extrem schwierig. Das Lesen von Beispielen halte ich für unakzeptabel.
    - "2011-02-21 19:00" < netAction> Ich möchte vielleicht Dinge eingeben wie "Berlin April 2011"

- add ordering capabilities for EventUrl and Filter using respectively ``order_with_respect_to =
  'event'`` and ``order_with_respect_to = 'user'`` in _meta of that classes. See
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/models/options/#order-with-respect-to
  New data base are needed to be created. An alter command won't probably work because they cannot
  be NULL.  Probably not working example::

    alter table "events_eventurl" add column "_order" integer NOT NULL;

- performance: at midnight calculate the next comming date of all events and
  save it in the data base. Use querysets everywhere, including ModelTable
  instead of Memory table for django_tables
- report problem button
- show form to enter an event if a search produces no result
- have some graphics to add to events with some flags, i.e. a floss-graphic
- marking events as "uninteresting", "interesting", "very interesting", "attending". Later:

    - uninteresting events can be left out in filters, notifications, etc.
    - other users can see which users are attending an event
    - other users can see the interesting events for a user
    - the system can tell you interesting users to you, i.e. users with similar interests to you

- add hCalendar_ , which is provided by the vobjects library, see the example about hcalendar at:

    - http://svn.osafoundation.org/vobject/trunk/test_vobject.py and
    - http://microformats.org/code/hcalendar/creator
    - See also http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern

- css/templates for handheld, see http://www.mediaevent.de/2009/10/css-iphones-handhelds/
- write documentation about e.g. installing the development server
- Check for bug http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11077
- add message to user invited to a group
- check hard wired urls like '/accounts/logout'
- for each event add a possibility of adding it to a group the user is member of (as public or
  private) may be with a nice grey icon, or two
- allow to introduce datas e.g. without the year or month, assuming it is this year and this month
- add comments to entries. See:
    http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/UsingFreeComment
    http://www.guindilla.eu/blog/2006/09/14/django-comments-framework-2/
- add an option "I will be there"
  Users should have friends (mayby group members are considered as friends as a profile option)
  who can be notified (as option in profile)
- timezones, see

  - http://pytz.sourceforge.net/
  - http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html

low priority
------------

- Database access for people who e.g. want to write something with libnotify. Can be restricted
  unless paying (money)
- Include a widget to know how to go to the event with the public transport, see
  http://code.google.com/p/public-transport-enabler
- include a picture when the server is under heavy load. Example: http://wurstball.de/41101/
- include import of sessions from Pentabarf
- Add future events of past events listed on http://www.guckes.net/cal/
- Add RSS support. See
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0//ref/contrib/syndication/#ref-contrib-syndication
- look and replace hard coded server name like in: templates/registration/activation_email.txt
- add captcha. example of how at e.g. http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/127/
- add in profiles to receive entries per email for e.g. a group, or group and location, or search
  string, etc. Add a link in the email for the icalc entry, etc.
- add an icon on events to e.g. get it as iCal, vCal
- for:user (like in del.icio.us)
- add 'interesting' to an event
- advanced group features like admins for groups, etc. See:
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#working-with-many-to-many-intermediary-models
- add in profiles an option to automatically add new entries inserted by a user in his external
  calendar like google calendar
- code a plugin for OpenSocial:
  http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/OpenSocial-1-0-veroeffentlicht-955569.html
- User profile can have external services attached. E.g.

  - Google Calendar
  - Facebook MyCalendar application
    http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#/apps/application.php?id=38610296669&ref=nf

  Each event entry should show an icon to add it when the user is logged in
- GridCalendar api. See e.g. http://fi.am/entry/building-a-website-api-with-django-part-2a-api-aut/
- OpenID. See
  http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Identity-Management-OpenID-mit-openid4java--/meldung/139607

- Develop a client for mobile devices, maybe one with JavaFX, as they run on Android, Desktops and
  Java ME mobile devices. Idea from http://brightkite.com/

  - Everywhere (default)
  - Region (100 km)
  - Metro (50 km)
  - City (10 km)
  - Area (4 km)
  - Neighbornhood (2 km)
  - Block (200 m)
  - Close (20 m)

- Idea for the main page::
   
    what happen  |   search: _________________________  (tag:xxx / group:xxx / location:continent/country/city user:xxx)
    today        |                                                                 it should also work with e.g. "floss berlin"
    (wikipedia)  |     2008                                           2009
                 |   ---------                                    ------------
    cloud tags   |
    related to   |     januar             february
    pass actions || | | | | | | |    | | | | | | | |

                 || | | | | | | |    | | | | | | | |


                    A number and color show how many entries for each square
                    You can click on a square to see the entries and also to introduce a new entry
                    You can mark more than one square like in Google calender

- Possible tag: for:user
    But the user must be in the system. Another option would be to have a list of contacts and for:user
    will send an email to him. Or it conects with the contacts of e.g. Google.

- To edit an entry, see example: http://www.djangosites.org/s/stopsoftwarepatents-eu/

- icons for each entry as a icalc, add to google calender (the user can save its loggin data), etc.

- icons for each entry to add an event to a group or to a personal list

- offer to send a nice generated calender with selected events as pdf

- use audio (netzsprecher or own VoIP) to
    a) comment entries
    b) automatic call for rememberings

- Money: companies can have links, e.g. 'map on Google' or 'map on Ding'

- Money: credit system: adding an event gives you credits, getting a notification substracts you
  credits. You can buy credits.
