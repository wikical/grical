Introduction
------------

**Grid Calendar** (abbreviated as **grical**), is an open web where people store
quickly a few information about interesting events, so that others can also
easily know about them. Grical makes easy and fast for its users to get
notified and store interesting events in its own external calendars.

Grical offers its **content as free content**  allowing its reuse by any party under the
conditions of the `CC-BY-SA license`_. Its source code is `Free Software`_ and
thus respects the `Open Knowledge Definition`_ and the
`Open Software Service Definition`_ of the `Open Knowledge Foundation`_.

Events in Grical can be edited by anyone like pages of the Wikipedia_. You can
*subscribe* to an event (or to the result of filters) to get notified of any
change, comment, or new event matching a filter.

Groups
------

Grical has groups. A group consist of some users and events. When an event is
public, comments and modifications of the event can be seen by anyone,
otherwise only by the members of the group. When a private event is added to a
group, a clone (i.e. a deep copy) of the event is created an attached to the
group. This means that a private event can have only one group.


Events as text
--------------

Events can be submitted per email to ``event ät gridmind.org``. The subject of the email is ignored.
Example of the body of an email::

Searches and filters
--------------------

- searches are done by default on the fields ``title``, ``acronym``, ``tags``, ``city`` and ``country``
- all given words must appear in at least one of the fields
- search results contain also related events (with similar tags), unless one or more of the special search options are used (see bellow)
- one or more dates in isoformat ( ``yyyy-mm-dd`` ) restrict the query to events with dates from the the oldest to the newest, or to one day if there is only one date
- If there is no date in the query only future events are showed
- Single words are looked up in the fields ``title``, ``tags``, ``city``, ``country`` and ``acronym``
- Tags ( ``#tag_name`` ) restricts the query to events with these tags
- Groups ( ``!group_name`` ) restricts the query to events of the groups
- Searches starting with an asterisk and one space makes the search broader, including past events
  (if no dates are specified), text in the description, urls (name and url), sessions (name) and deadlines (name)
- Locations restricts the query to events within the given location. There are four possibilities. When given a distance ``km`` (kilometers) and ``mi`` (miles) are allowed as units.
  
  - giving a simple word ( ``@word`` ) which is looked up in the fields ``city`` or ``country``
  - giving the name of a place and a distance. ``@london+100`` would look 100
    kilometers arround the center of the most relevant place with the name ``london`` (being it London in Great Britain). The country can be specified with e.g. ``@london,ca`` (the most relevant city with the name London in Canada).
  - giving a coordinate and a distance ( ``@52.55247,13.40364+500km`` )
  - giving four coordinates defining a rectangle: longitude_west,
    longitude_east, latitude_north, latitude_south. Example: ``@13.324,13.463,52.5503,52.4701``

- Any search can be saved as a filter by logged-in users. To be able to logg-in
  you need to register. A confirmation email will be sent in the proccess.

- You can select to get notified of new events matching one of your filters.

- The result of searches also have a `RSS feed`_ which can be subscribed even
  by non-logged-in users.

- The result of searches also have an `iCalendar file`_ which can be imported in
  external calendars.

- Both the `RSS feed`_ and the `iCalendar file`_ will contain in the future new
  events.

Event history and event deletions
---------------------------------

Since events can be modified by anyone, including anonymous (not logged-in)
users, Grical stores (remembers) all revisions (states) of events. All
revisions of an event is called history, like the history of an entry in the
Wikipedia.

Only logged-in users can delete or revert an event to a previous revision.

When an event is deleted, it is possible to indicate another event containing
the information of the deleted event. Users trying to access the deleted event
will be then redirected to the other one.
