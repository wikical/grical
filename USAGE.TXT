Events
------

An event can be public or private. Public events can be edited by anyone like pages of the
Wikipedia_. You can *subscribe* to an event to get notified of any change, comment, etc. Private
events can be seen and edited only by the submitter of the event and the the group the event belongs
to. When a private event is added to a group, the event is clone (i.e. a deep copy of the event is
done) and is accessible and modifiable only by the members of the group. I.e. each private event
belongs to a single group.

The public/private flag of an event cannot be changed after creation, but an
event can be cloned (copy) into any other group the user is also a member of.

Events submitted by anonymous users are public.

The main reason of private events belonging only to a single group is that events have comments, and
members of a group commenting on an event might not want non-members to see their comments. Another
important reason is that you might trust the members of a group, but not the whole world in
order to keep the information of an event accurate and interesting to you.

When a private event is clone to another group, the comments are not copied.

Groups
------

A group consist of some users and events. When an event is public, comments and
modifications of the event can be seen by anyone, otherwise only by the members
of the group. When a private event is added to a group, a clone (i.e. a deep
copy) of the event is created an attached to the group. This means that a
private event can have only one group.

The field ``description`` must be the last one and its content can contain multiple lines. If the
content is in valid ReStructuredText__ syntax, it will be rendered accordingly.

Searches and filters
--------------------

- searches are done by default on the fields ``title``, ``acronym``, ``tags``, ``city`` and ``country``
- all given words must appear in at least one of the fields
- search results contain also related events (with similar tags), unless one or more of the special search options are used (see bellow)
- one or more dates in isoformat (``yyyy-mm-dd``) restrict the query to events with dates from the the lowest to the highest, or to one day if there is only one date
- If there is no date in the query only future events are showed
- Single words are looked up in the fields ``title``, ``tags``, ``city``, ``country`` and ``acronym``
- Tags (``#tag_name``) restricts the query to events with these tags
- Locations (``@location_name``) restricts the query to events having these location in the fields ``city`` or ``country``
- Groups (``!group_name``) restricts the query to events of the groups
- Searches starting with an asterisk and one space (``* ``) makes the search broader, including past events
  (if no dates are specified), text in the description, urls (name and url), sessions (name) and deadlines (name)
