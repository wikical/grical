How to use GridCalendar
=======================

Events
------

An event can be public or private. Public events can be edited by anyone like
pages of the Wikipedia_. You can *subscribe* to an event to get notified of any
change, comment, etc. Private events can be seen and edited only by the
submitter of the event and the groups the submitter chooses. When a private
event is added to a group, the event is clone (i.e. a deep copy of the event is
done) and is accessible and modifiable for all current and future members of
the group.

The public/private flag of an event cannot be changed after creation, but an
event can be cloned and the flag of the clone can be different.

Events submitted by anonymous users are public.

The main rational of private events belonging only to a single group is that
events have comments, and members of a group commenting on an event might not
want non-members to see their comments.

When a private event is clone to another group, the comments are not copied.

Groups
------

A group consist of some users and events. When an event is public, comments and
modifications of the event can be seen by anyone, otherwise only by the members
of the group. When a private event is added to a group, a clone (i.e. a deep
copy) of the event is created an attached to the group. This means that a
private event can have only one group.

Events as text
--------------

Events can be submitted per email to `event Ã¤t gridmind.org`. The subject of the email is ignored.
Example of the body of an email::
