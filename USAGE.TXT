How to use GridCalendar
=======================

Events
------

An event can be public or private. Public events can be edited by anyone like pages of the
Wikipedia_. You can *subscribe* to an event to get notified of any change, comment, etc. Private
events can be seen and edited only by the submitter of the event and the groups the submitter
chooses. When a private event is added to a group, the event is clone (i.e. a deep copy of the event
is done) and is accessible and modifiable for all current and future members of the group.

The public/private flag of an event cannot be changed after creation, but an event can be cloned and
the flag of the clone can be different.

Events submitted by anonymous users are public.

The main rational of private events belonging only to a single group is that events have comments,
and members of a group commenting on an event might not want non-members to see their comments.

When a private event is clone to another group, the comments are not copied.

Groups
------

A group consist of some users and events. When an event is public, comments and modifications of the event
can be seen by anyone, otherwise only by the members of the group. When a private event is added to
a group, a clone (i.e. a deep copy) of the event is created an attached to the group. This means
that a private event can have only one group.

Events as text
--------------

Events can be submitted and retrieved as plain text for example per E-Mail.

Searches and filters
--------------------

When searching or creating filters, words are searched matching substrings of the fields ``title`` and ``descriptions``, but also full words of the fields ``acronym``, ``tags``, ``country`` and ``city``. It is an OR-search showing the events with the most number of matches first.

Filters also can use the fields ``start``, ``end``, ``public`` and ``user``
