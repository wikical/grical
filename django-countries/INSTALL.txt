Django Countries
   World Countries and US States for Django projects 


To install it copy 'countries' into your django site directory.
Add 'countries' to the list of installed apps and run syncdb 
and you're good to go.

Note: 
   The models are fixed to the country and usstate tables.
   Se models.py for details.


And for the flags hed over to:
   http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/

and download the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code flag package. 
Add a 'flags' director to your media root and copy the .gif flags there. 

An alternative flag resource is: 
   http://www.ip2location.com/flagsoftheworld.aspx

Optionally add:
   COUNTRIES_FLAG_PATH = '<path relative to media root>flags/%s.png'

to django settings if you want to have the flags in an alternative location 
or use .png instead of the default .gif ( .gif is just a tiny bit smaller ;) 


Note that this application requires Python 2.4 or later, and Django SVN.
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
