Introduction
------------

**GriCal** (which is a short form for **Grid Calendar**) is an open web where
people store quickly a few information about interesting events, so that others
can also easily know about them. GriCal also makes easy and fast to
get notified and store interesting events in its own external calendars.

GriCal offers its **content as free content**  allowing its reuse by any party under the
conditions of the `CC-BY-SA license`_. Its source code is `Free Software`_ and
thus respects the `Open Knowledge Definition`_ and the
`Open Software Service Definition`_ of the `Open Knowledge Foundation`_.

Events in GriCal can be edited by anyone like pages of the Wikipedia_. The
description of an event is rendered using ReStructuredText_ syntax.

You can *subscribe* to an event (or to the result of filters) to get notified
of any change, comment, or new event matching a filter.

Groups
------

GriCal has groups. A group consist of some users and events. Groups allows its
users to create lists of events to monitor them or to offer them on another
platform.


Searches and filters
--------------------

- Searches are done by default on the fields ``title``, ``acronym``, ``tags``, ``city`` and
  ``country``.
- All given words must appear in at least one of the fields.
- Search results contain also related events (with similar tags), unless one or more of the special
  search restrictions are used (like # for tags, see bellow)
- Dates in ISO-format ( ``yyyy-mm-dd`` ) restrict the query to events with dates from the
  oldest to the newest, including events with a deadline in the range and events taking place during
  the range. If only one date is provided (instead of two or more) only events with a matching
  date (start, end or a dateline) are shown. Example: `2011-01-01 2011-12-31`_
- If there is no date in the query and the broad operator is not used, only future events are showed.
- Tags ( ``#tag_name`` ) restricts the query to events with these tags. Example: `#linux`_
- Groups ( ``!group_name`` ) restricts the query to events of the group. Example:`!ffii`_
- Words starting with a ``+`` restrict the query to events matching the word in the fields
  ``title``, ``acronym``, ``city`` and ``country`` without related events. Example: `+software`_
- The string `` | `` (space pipe space) can be used to concatenate results of different searches
  (logical or). For example `#linux | #foss`_ will search for all future events with the tag
  ``linux`` or ``foss`` or both.
- Searches starting with `` * `` (asterisk space) makes the search broader, including past events
  (if no dates are specified), text in the description, URLs (name and URL), sessions (name) and
  deadlines (name). Example: `* http://events.linuxfoundation.org/`__
- Locations (``@location``) restricts the query to events within the given location. **Location terms
  must be added at the end of the query** (spaces in the name of locations are possible like
  ``@Los Angeles``). When given a distance, ``km`` (kilometers) and ``mi`` (miles) are allowed as
  units. There are **four possibilities**:

__ http://grical.org/s/?query=*+http%3A%2F%2Fevents.linuxfoundation.org%2F

  - Giving a simple word ( ``@word`` ) which is looked up in the fields ``city`` or ``country``.
    Example: `@berlin`_
  - Giving the name of a place and a distance. `@london+100`_ would look 100
    kilometers around the center of the most relevant place with the name ``london`` (being it
    London in Great Britain). The country can be specified with e.g. `@london,ca`_ (the most
    relevant city with the name London in Canada).
  - Giving a coordinate and a distance ( `@52.55247,13.40364+500km`_ ).
  - Giving four coordinates defining a rectangle: longitude_west,
    longitude_east, latitude_north, latitude_south. Example: `@13.324,13.463,52.5503,52.4701`_.

- The operator ``=`` restrict the search to one single event, the one having the number which
  follows the operator (example ``=123``). This can be used for e.g. sending a list of some events
  as a URL and showing them on a map, example: http://grical.org/s/?query=%3D123+%7C+%3D789&view=map

- Any search can be saved as a filter by logged-in users. To be able to log-in
  you need to register. An email will be sent in the process with a URL that you need to click.

- You can select to get notified of new events matching one of your filters.

- The result of searches also have a `RSS feed`_ which can be subscribed even
  by non-logged-in users.

- The result of searches also have an `iCalendar file`_ which can be imported in
  external calendars.

- Both the `RSS feed`_ and the `iCalendar file`_ will contain in the future new
  events.

Events as text
--------------

Events can be submitted per email to ``event Ã¤t gridmind.org``. The subject of the email is ignored.
Example of the body of an email::

    title: Grical presentation
    start: 2010-12-29
    tags: calendar software open-source gridmind grical
    web: http://example.com

You can optionally include more data in the submission. Example::

    acronym: GriCal
    title: Grical presentation
    start: 2010-12-29
    starttime: 10:00
    end: 2010-12-30
    endtime: 18:00
    tags: calendar software open-source gridmind grical
    urls:
        code    http://example.com
        web    http://example.com
    address: Gleimstr. 6, Berlin 10439, DE
    coordinates: 52.55247, 13.40364
    deadlines:
        2009-11-01    visitor tickets
        2010-10-01    call for papers
    timezone: 60
    sessions:
        2010-12-29    10:00-11:00    first presentation
        2010-12-29    15:00-16:00    second presentation
        2010-12-30    15:00-16:00    third presentation
    description:

    Grical will be presented

The field ``description`` must be the last one and its content can contain multiple lines. The
content is rendered as ReStructuredText_.


Recurring events
----------------

A recurring event is one that happens again after a period of time. For
instance a weekly or monthly meeting.

It is possible to create and edit recurrences of an event in GriCal by using
the web interface: edit the event and select *recurrences*

It is also possible to **add** recurrences in GriCal by editing an event as
text, but it is not possible to edit its recurrences. Example of adding two
recurrences::

    title: Grical presentation
    start: 2010-12-29
    tags: calendar software open-source gridmind grical
    web: http://example.com
    dates:
        2011-01-01
        2011-01-02

Notice that the recurrences will have the same data except for the start date,
the deadlines and the sessions.


Event history and event deletions
---------------------------------

Since events can be modified by anyone, including anonymous (not logged-in)
users, GriCal stores (remembers) all revisions (states) of events. All
revisions of an event is called history, like the history of an entry in the
Wikipedia.

Only logged-in users can delete or revert an event to a previous revision.

When an event is deleted, it is possible to indicate another event containing
the information of the deleted event. Users trying to access the deleted event
will be then redirected to the other one.


API

GriCal content can be integrated in external pages. See `the wiki page about our API`__
